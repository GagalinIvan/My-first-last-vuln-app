This is a vulnerable application developed by me solely for educational purposes, in order to show that I own a stack of technologies. Such as: gitlab ci, php, css, html, mariadb, phpmyadmin, sonarqube, docker, owasp zap.

I'm not a php developer and therefore do not claim the title of "breakthrough of the year" or "best site". Thank you for your attention.

If you want you can take this idea for free.
